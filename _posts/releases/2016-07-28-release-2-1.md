It is with great pleasure that I announce the general availability of Singularity version 2.1! This is the second release in the 2.x series and includes the following features over and above the previous release:

## Feature additions:

- Configuration file for system administrator control over what Singularity features users are allowed to use
- Support for non Gnu LibC based distributions (e.g. Alpine Linux)
- Source file restructuring and refactoring
- Added message(), and enabled very verbose debugging
- Be smarter about when to avoid separation of the PID namespace
- Log container runs to syslog()
- Support custom container environments (via container:/environment)
- Sanitized source files for Flawfinder

## Bug fixes:

- Fix bug with /run and /var directories being read only in some situations
- Fix lots of bootstrap definition issues
- Fixed issue with /dev/pts not being mounted within a container
- Resolved some issues with image file de-looping
- Fixed bugs related to very restrictive umasks set

Enjoy!
