It is with great pleasure that I announce the general availability of Singularity version 2.2! Here's what's in store for version 2.2 from your favorite Git clone, download, or distribution vendor:

* A complete rework of the back end source code to allow a much larger feature set, sanity, and facilitate contributions
* The ability to execute completely unprivileged (does not support Singularity images) (thanks to Brian Bockelman)
* Container execute by URI support (file, http, https, docker, etc..)
* Integration with the Docker Registry Remote API (thanks to Vanessa Sochat):
    * stateless containers running ad-hoc
    * bootstrapping
    * importing
* OverlayFS support - Allows for automatic creation of bind points within containers at runtime (thanks to Amanda Duffy and Jarrod Johnson)
* Additional container formats supported (directories and archives)
* New bootstrap definition format to handle much more complicated and intuitive recipes
* All Singularity 2.x containers continue to be supported with this release.

Release tip: The best way to kill an idea is to take it to a meeting.
