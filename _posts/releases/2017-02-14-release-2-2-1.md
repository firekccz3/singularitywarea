For the full release announcement and downloads, please see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.2.1">the release on GitHub</a>.

This release includes a fix for a Moderate Severity security issue, and other improvements to version 2.2.

## Security information:

In versions of Singularity previous to 2.2.1, it was possible for a malicious user to create and manipulate specifically crafted raw devices within containers they own. Utilizing `MS_NODEV` as a container image mount option mitigates this potential vector of attack. As a result, this update should be implemented with high urgency. A big thanks to Mattias Wadenstein (@UMU in Sweden) for identifying and reporting this issue!


### Other improvements:

* Fixed some leaky file descriptors
* Cleaned up `*printf()` usage
* Catch if user's group is not properly defined

Please report any additional bugs <a href="https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/new" target="_blank">as issues</a>.

Thank you!
