This is a bugfix release for the 2.x series, and includes fixes for:

- Contain option no longer maintains current working directory
- Remove need to obtain a shared lock on the image (was failing on some shared file systems)
- Move creation of a container's /environment to the beginning of the bootstrap (so it can be modified via a bootstrap definition file

Enjoy!
