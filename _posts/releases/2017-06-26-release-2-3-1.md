<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.3.1">This release</a> includes a fix for a High Severity security issue on older hosts, and other improvements and fixes to previous versions of Singularity. 

## Security Information:

A potential escalation pathway was identified that could have allowed a malicious user to escalate their privileges on hosts that do not support the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag for the `prctl()` system call. This release fixes this as well as several other identified bugs and potential race conditions.

Please report any additional bugs to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/new">our issues board.</a>

Thanks to the hard work of all our contributors to nail this bug in the butt!
