This is a bug fix point release to the 2.5 feature branch.

## Bug fixes
  * Corrected a permissions error when attempting to run Singularity from a
directory on NFS with root_squash enabled
  * Fixed a bug that closed a socket early, preventing correct container
execution on hosts using identity services like SSSD
  * Fixed a regression that broke the debootstrap agent

And as always, report any bugs to:
