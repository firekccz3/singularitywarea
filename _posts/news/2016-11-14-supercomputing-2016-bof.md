On behalf of Greg, the <a href="http://sc16.supercomputing.org/conference-components/technical-program-tues-fri/birds-of-a-feather-sessions-bofs/" target="_blank">BoF</a> will be on Thursday at 10:00 a.m, hosted by a group from <a href="http://www.aeoncomputing.com/" target="_blank">Aeon Computing</a>. There will be no vendor pitch, just a casual place to hang out and chat about technical stuff and whatever else. Aeon is also pitching in some coffee and donuts, cause thatâ€™s how they roll.
