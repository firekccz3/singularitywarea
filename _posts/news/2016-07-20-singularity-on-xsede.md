The team at XSEDE has announced Singularity deployment on SDSC Comet and Gordon: <a href="https://www.xsede.org/news/-/news/item/7624" target="_blank">in this press release!</a>.

>> SDSC has deployed Singularity, which enables deployment of user-space containers, on Comet and Gordon. Singularity is a platform to support users that have different system environment needs than what is provided on HPC resources. Singularity leverages a workflow and security model that makes it viable on multi-tenant HPC resources like Comet and Gordon without requiring any modifications to the scheduler or system architecture. Additionally, all typical HPC functions can be leveraged within a Singularity container (e.g. InfiniBand, high performance file systems, GPUs, etc.). While Singularity supports MPI running in a hybrid model where you invoke MPI outside the container and it runs the MPI programs inside the container, this aspect is currently under testing.
