Hi Singularity Community!

Thanks to everyone that provided comments on the early draft for SCI-F. The goals were initially:

 - write specification draft (this was done via a Google Doc)
 - implement into Singularity (now in [development branch](https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/blob/docs/2.4/pages/docs/user-docs/docs-apps.md))
 - get feedback on both, adjust implementation and draft
 - do several (N=4) implemented use cases for SCI-F, write up ([available here](http://containers-ftw.org/apps/category/#Example))
 - make an interactive, open source repository to contribute and share SCI-F apps [http://containers-ftw.org/apps/](http://containers-ftw.org/apps/)
 - write up the (almost) "final" draft formally [http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/](http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/)

I'm (`@vsoch`) happy to report that I've finished the above, and I'd like to ask the following:

 - if you contributed, please check the AUTHORS file in the SCI-F repository to make sure that I added you, and spelled your name correctly (apologies in advance).
 - Any further suggestions, additions, or entire new contributions can be added to the draft by way of pull request. I'm not in any rush, and if you have a good contribution, I want to help.
 - If you have not contributed yet and would like to, see the ideas linked on the [draft abstract page](http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/). 

The plan is (as of now) to submit this no later than the end of October, and I want to make sure everyone that wants to contribute has had ample chance. Indeed, with Singularity there are many ways to cook your container, and SCi-F definitely exemplifies that.
