<h1>Singularity Run</h1>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Singularity 'run' allows you to define a custom action to be taken when a
container is either 'run' or executed directly by file name. The action is
defined by a Singularity "runscript" which is an executable file (script or
binary) located within the container physically at '/singularity'.
</p>
<p>
The usage is as follows:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>
$ singularity run
USAGE: singularity (options) run [container image] (options)
</code>
</pre>
The command that you want to exec will follow the container image along with
any additional arguments will all be passed directly to the program being
executed within the container.
</p>
<p>
You can also execute the container directly, and it will automatically
pass the execution process to the Singularity runscript along with any
arguments.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Here is a basic runscript
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>
$ cat singularity
#!/bin/sh
echo "$@"
$ chmod +x singularity
</code>
</pre>

Now to copy it into the container:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>
$ sudo singularity copy container.img singularity /
$ singularity exec container.img ls -l /singularity
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 20 Jun  1 18:14 /singularity
</code>
</pre>

Now to run the container:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>
$ singularity run container.img "hello world"
hello world
</code>
</pre>

And to execute the container directly:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>
$ ./container.img "hello again"
hello again
$ 
</code>
</pre>
</p>
