<h1>Contributing to Singularity</h1>
<p>
We are always interested in having help! If you want to join the party, there
are several areas you can help!
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation
dillemma... We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before
working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this, we want to
share the love so nobody feels left out!
</p>
<p>
To contribute to the web based documentation, you should obtain a GitHub
account and fork the Singularity repository. Once forked, change to the
'gh-pages' branch and check out the 'content/' directory. In there you will
find all of the base HTML files for all of the pages. You will only need
to write the page HTML because each file will automatically be included into
the page template by javascript functions (examples of javascript links can
be seen in the existing pages).
</p>
<p>
There is also a strong desire to write a user manual for Singularity, so if
this is something you are interested in, please join the
<a href='https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!forum/singularity'>Google Group</a>
and let us know!
</p>

<h2>Support, helping and spreading the word!</h2>
<p>
This is a huge endavor, and it is greatly appreciated! If you have been using
Singularity and having good luck with it, join our
<a href='https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!forum/singularity'>Google Group</a>
and help out other users! Post to online communities about Singularity, and
request that your distribution vendor, service provider, and system
administrators include Singularity for you!
</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
To contribute to the development of Singularity, you must:
<ul>
<li>Own the code and/or have the right to contribute it</li>
<li>Be able to submit software under the 3 clause BSD license</li>
<li>Read, understand and agree to the <a href="javascript:load_content('license')">license</a></li>
<li>Have a <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Types of contributions</h3>
<p>
It is important to understand the different types of contributions:
</p>

<h4>Patches (bug fixes, minor enhancements)</h4>
<p>
Contributions that fix software bugs or leverage existing Singularity code
(derivitives of Singularity) are considered patches. Patches generally do
not assert copyright as they are not original code.
</p>

<h4>Existing Code Contributions</h4>
<p>
It maybe possible to leverage an existing code as part of Singularity, and
this can be done pending the original code is of a compatible BSD license.
While other licenses may work, they will have to be considered on a case by
case basis. Copyrights will obviously reflect the existing code that is
being integrated.
</p>

<h4>New Code Contributions</h4>
<p>
New code contributions provide new features, functionality, and are original
"clean room" works. These code contributions are not bug fixes or derivitive
works of other software solutions and they do allow someone to assert a
copyright line in the source file that they updated or created. The project's
copyright must also be included at the top of the new file, with subsequent
copyright notices following.
</p>
<p>
The deliniation between new code and patch work can sometimes be blurry, so
if you have a question if a particular patch should assert a copyright notice
then please ask one of the lead developers.
