<h1>About Singularity</h1>
<br/>
<h4 class="loud">Background</h4>
<p>
Software development on Linux is moving in a new direction. Thanks to
advances in virtualization and container technologies, developers are
finding it very convenient to distribute instances of their entire
build/development environment in addition to or instead of source code
alone. There are some benefits and drawbacks to this model.
</p>
<p>
Some of the benefits of distributing software in this fashion include
being able to provide a configuration free implementation which can
easily be replicated to distribute a software or work flow. The user
does not need to worry about managing potentially complicated
dependency chains nor worry about configuration nuances.
</p>
<p>
The drawbacks are numerous, but tend to focus on several major areas:
container overhead, container technology and architecture concerns (e.g.,
privilege escalation and network/file system access), and work flow
compatibility.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">The Singularity Solution</h4>
<p>
Singularity containers are purpose built and can include a simple
binary and library stack or a complicated work flow that includes both
network and file system access (or anything in between). The
Singularity container images are then completely portable to any binary
compatible version of Linux with the only dependency being Singularity
running on the target system.
</p>
<p>
Singularity blocks privilege escalation within the container so if you
want to be root inside the container, you first must be root outside the
container. This usage paradigm mitigates many of the security concerns
that exists with containers on multi-tenant shared resources. You can
directly call programs inside the container from outside the container
fully incorporating pipes, standard IO, file system access, X11, and
MPI makes it easy to incorporate into your environment.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Portability</h4>
<p>
Singularity containers are designed to be as portable as possible,
spanning many flavors and vintages of Linux. The only known i86
limitation is the version of Linux running on the host. Singularity
has been ported to distributions going as far back as RHEL 5 (and
compatibles) and works on all flavors of Debian, Gentoo and
Slackware. Within the container, there are almost no limitations
aside from basic binary compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Within the container, there could be an entire distribution of Linux
or a very lightweight tuned set of packages to support a particular
work-flow. The work-flow can be scripted to run completely within the
container or interact with files and other programs outside the
container. The container can also emulate a single program and can
be executed directly (yes, you heard that right). Containers have
the execute bit set such they can be executed and configured to run
a defined script or program when executed in this manner.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Reproducibility</h4>
<p>
Each Singularity image includes all of the application's necessary
run-time libraries and can even include the required data and files
for a particular application to run. This encapsulation of the entire
user-space environment facilitates not only portability but also
reproducibility.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">License</h4>
<p>
Singularity is released under a modified BSD license. The only modification
being that you may not use the names of any project members or contributors
(namely UC or the US Department of Energy) to endorse or promote products or
services derived from or using this software.
