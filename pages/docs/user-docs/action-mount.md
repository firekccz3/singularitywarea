Singularity allows you to map directories on your host system to directories within your container using bind mounts.  This allows you to read and write data on the host system with ease.

## Overview
When Singularity 'swaps' the host operating system for the one inside your container, the host file systems becomes inaccessible. But you may want to read and write files on the host system from within the container. To enable this functionality Singularity will *bind* directories  back in via two primary methods: system defined bind points and conditional user defined bind points.

To *mount* a bind path inside the container, a **bind point** must be defined within the container. The bind point is a directory within the container that Singularity can use to bind a directory on the host system.  This means that if you want to bind to a point within the container such as `/global`, that directory must already exist within the container.

It is however possible that the system administrator has enabled a Singularity feature called *overlay* in the `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` file. This will cause the bind points to be created on an as needed basis in an overlay file system so that the underlying container is not modified. But because the *overlay* feature is not always used or is unavailable in some kernels, it may be necessary for container standards to exist to ensure portability from host to host.

If a bind path is requested, and the bind point does not exist within the container, a warning message will be displayed, and Singularity will continue trying to start the container. For example:

```bash
$ singularity shell --bind /global /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img 
WARNING: Non existent bind point (directory) in container: '/global'
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img> 
```

Even though `/global` did not exist inside the container, the shell command printed a warning but continued on. If we enable `enable overlay = yes` in the `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` you will find that we no longer get the error and `/global` is created and accessible as expected:

```bash
$ singularity shell --bind /global /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img 
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img> 
```

### System defined bind points
The system administrator has the ability to define what bind points will be included automatically inside each container. The bind paths are locations on the host's root file system which should also be visible within the container. Some of the bind paths are automatically derived (e.g. a user's home directory) and some are statically defined (e.g. `bind path = ` in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`).


### User defined bind points
If the system administrator has enabled user control of binds (via `user bind control = yes` in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`), you will be able to request your own bind points within your container. 

Further, if the administrator has enabled the use of file system overlay (via `enable overlay = yes` in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf`), you can bind host system directories to directories that do not exist within the container.  Singularity will dynamically create the necessary bind points in your container on demand.  This feature may not be supported on older host systems.

Here's an example of using the `--bind` option and binding `/tmp` to `/scratch` (which may not already exist within the container if file system overlay is enabled):

```bash
$ singularity shell -B /tmp:/scratch /tmp/Centos7-ompi.img 
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity.Centos7-ompi.img> ls /scratch
ssh-7vywtVeOez  systemd-private-cd84c81dda754fe4a7a593647d5a5765-ntpd.service-12nMO4
```
