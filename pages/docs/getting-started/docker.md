Singularity is good friends with Docker. You can do all of the following:

- Import a Docker image into a Singularity image
- Bootstrap a Docker image as the base for a Singularity image
- Use Docker to generate a development environment with Singularity and/or Docker

Details will be coming soon for each of these!
